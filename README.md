# pebble

Created a "karate font" themed watchface using the Pebble SDK available to developers online.  The face is authored in C and utilizes the "karate' ttf font.  Upon instantiation, watch uses 'ctime' to gather time and date, using an overlay method not dissimilar to the Stanford graphics library.  <br>Future improvements will include:<br><br>
changing backlight timeout<br>
sports score integration<br>
